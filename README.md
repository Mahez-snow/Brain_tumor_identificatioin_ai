✨ Key Features

🧠 **MRI Brain Tumor Classification**
Detects 4 classes:

* Glioma
* Meningioma
* Pituitary
* No Tumor

📊 **Confidence Score & Probability Matrix**
Displays prediction confidence and full probability breakdown for all classes.

🔥 **Grad-CAM Explainability (Medical Visualization)**
Highlights the exact region where AI focuses inside MRI for transparent decision-making.

🎨 **Advanced Clinical UI**
Modern, high-tech diagnostic interface built with Streamlit + custom CSS.

☁️ **Cloud Model Hosting (HuggingFace)**
Model hosted externally for lightweight GitHub deployment.
